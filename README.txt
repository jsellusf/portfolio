I had hoped to do a grid layout for this project, but I found it difficult with Flex Box. I much prefer using the grid method of styling vs FlexBox, but I tried my best here. I don't think it was my best outcome style-wise, but it is what it is. I had a hard time coming up with content for the page and I feel there's two much whitespace. I'll need more practice to be able to independently control the size of the different sections.Since I'm working on an ultra-wide monitor, I attempted to add a media query for ultra-wide monitors, but am not happy with the way it turned out. This project helped me identify area where I am weak in regards to FlexStop.
